## 👋 Hey, I’m Santosh Kumar Shah

Not here to follow the crowd.
Not here to explain every line of my code either.

I’m a frontend developer who treats the web like a canvas —
design first, logic sharp, creativity always on.

# 🧠 About Me
* 🎓 Student (officially)
* 🎨 Creative by nature, dev by obsession
* 🌐 Frontend-focused (Only for a few time 😒)
* 🧪 I build things for fun, not just for flex
* ⚠️ Most of my repos follow one rule:
  *It works. Don’t touch it.*
  

# 🔥 My Coding Philosophy

* Code should feel something, not just run
* Clean when needed, chaotic when effective
* I don’t chase trends — I bend them
* If my project looks simple, look closer
* 

# 🧩 INTRO

* Web design that doesn’t look like a tutorial project
* Turning ideas into interfaces
* Open source (learning, breaking, improving)
* Poetry… but in pixels and layouts

# 🕶️ Fun Facts

* Age? Certified 18. Reality? Let the code decide 🤪
* I don’t need coffee — creativity is enough
* Described as **Mad** by friends (accurate)

# 🚀 Currently

* Sharpening frontend skills
* Exploring better design + UX
* Building quietly, improving loudly

# 🧠 Final Note

If you’re here expecting “Hello World” energy,
you might be in the wrong repo.

*🙏🏻 Welcome anyway 🙏🏻.*
