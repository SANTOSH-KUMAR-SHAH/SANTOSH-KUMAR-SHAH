# 👋 Hey, I’m Santosh...

Not here to follow the crowd.
And definitely not here to document every line of my code.

I build because I feel like building.
I design because plain interfaces annoy me.
And I code because ideas deserve to exist outside the mind.

Frontend developer — yes.
But more accurately?

🎨 I treat the web like a canvas
🎭 And the browser like a stage

Design first.
Logic sharp.
Creativity always on.


## 🧠 Who I Am (Beyond the Labels)

Officially, I’m a student.

Unofficially, I’m someone obsessed with turning imagination into interfaces.

I don’t build projects to flex.
I build them to experiment. To test limits. To break structure — and rebuild it better.

Most of my repositories follow one simple rule:

⚠️ If it works — Don’t-touch it.

Perfection is overrated.
Impact isn’t.
  

## 🔥 The Way I Think About Code

Code shouldn’t just run.

It should feel intentional.

Sometimes clean.
Sometimes chaotic.
Always effective.

I don’t chase trends. I study them — then bend them.

If one of my projects looks simple at first glance, look closer.
The details are rarely accidental.

## 🧩 What I Actually Do

I create web designs that don’t look like they came from a tutorial.

I turn rough ideas into usable experiences.

I experiment with layout, spacing, typography, and motion — not because it’s required, but because it’s possible.

Open source, for me, isn’t about showing off.

🌍 It’s about learning in public.
🛠 Breaking things publicly.
📈 Improving publicly.

It’s poetry — just written in pixels.

## 🕶 The Human Side

Age? Officially 18.
Mentally? Still evolving.
Creatively? Unstable — in the best way.

☕ I don’t depend on coffee.
⚡ Curiosity is enough fuel.

Friends often call me “Polymath”
I call it Curiosity.


## 🚀 Right Now

Sharpening frontend skills.
Understanding design deeper.
Exploring UX beyond aesthetics.

Building quietly.
Improving loudly.

## 🧠 Final Thought

If you’re expecting “Hello World” energy…

You’re in the wrong Repo.

But if you’re curious about ideas turned into interfaces —

Most ✨ Welcome.
